Insights from dashboard
•	Average Delay: Flights experience an average delay of 19 minutes, slightly less than the previous year's monthly average of 20 minutes.

•	Flight Cancellations: Approximately 2% of flights have been canceled, representing a relatively small percentage of the total flights.

•	Flight Matches: A substantial number of flights, totaling 1,807,333, have been successfully scheduled and completed.

•	Scheduled vs Chartered Flights: The majority of flights, accounting for 83.84%, are scheduled charters, while only 16.16% are chartered flights.

•	Comparative Analysis: A bar graph highlights a notable disparity between the number of flights matched and the number of flights canceled, underscoring a high rate of successful flight operations compared to cancellations.


These insights suggest that the flight operations are quite efficient, with a high success rate of scheduled flights and a low cancellation rate. The slight decrease in average delay compared to the previous year also indicates an improvement in punctuality.

















## ii.	Monthly Statistics Dashboard

Insights from Dashboard

•	Average delay durations vary by month, with March recording the highest average delay of 21 minutes.

•	January and February exhibit lower average delays of 14 and 13 minutes respectively, indicating better punctuality at the beginning of the year.

•	The dashboard facilitates a comparison between the current year's average delay and that of the previous year, serving as a benchmark for performance assessment.

•	The percentage of flight cancellations remains consistent at 2% across the displayed months, indicating a steady cancellation rate.

•	A notable number of flights were successfully matched, with January recording 121,098 matches, signifying effective scheduling and completion of flights.

•	The bar graph categorizes delays into time ranges for each month, offering a detailed breakdown of the average percentage of flights experiencing delays within these segments, providing passengers with a comprehensive overview of the delay distribution.

•	It's evident that the majority of delays last for only 15 minutes. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for analyzing performance and identifying areas for improvement in flight scheduling and punctuality. The visualizations help in quickly understanding the patterns and trends in flight delays and cancellations over the months.























## iii.	Previous Year V/S Current Year

Insights from dashboard

•	Both years show fluctuations in delay times, with peaks suggesting increased delays around the middle of the year and a reduction towards the end.

•	The graph indicates that both the previous and current years follow a similar pattern of delays throughout the months.

•	The purple line represents the current year’s average delay minutes and the yellow line for the previous year’s average delay both peak and trough at similar times of the year.

•	The bar at the bottom, “Previous Year Flights matched vs Current Year Flights Matched,” shows the number of flights matched in the current year, ranging from 0K to 200K. This suggests a considerable number of flights were successfully scheduled and completed as planned.























## iv.	City Statistics

Insights from dashboard

•	The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of flight operations across diverse cities.

•	For instance, Warsaw (Chopin) experiences an average delay of 17 minutes with no recorded flight cancellations, and a previous year's monthly average delay of 24 minutes.

•	Similarly, Washington (Dulles) exhibits an average delay of 17 minutes, with 1% of flights cancelled, and a previous year's average delay of 18 minutes.

•	Cities like Warsaw demonstrate a notable number of flights matched, indicating successful completion, with 6,741 flights matched.

•	This dashboard facilitates a comparison between the current year's performance and that of the previous year, focusing on average delays and cancellations. This analysis aids in identifying trends and areas for enhancing flight punctuality and operational efficiency.

•	The horizontal bar graphs at the bottom contrast the number of flights cancelled with those matched for different countries and cities. This visual depiction swiftly highlights operational strengths and challenges encountered by airlines across various regions.
