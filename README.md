In this Project, a data warehouse will be designed for an aircraft punctuality dataset, which comprises 12 CSV files, each representing a month in 2023. The dataset encompasses variables such as Reporting Period, Reporting Airport, Origin Destination Country, Origin Destination, Airline Name, Scheduled Charter, and numerous columns indicating different elements of flight punctuality metrics.

For the creation of the data warehouse schema, dimension tables will be crafted for Reporting Period, Airport, and Airline, alongside a fact table for flight punctuality data. These tables will be generated using SQL queries, ensuring appropriate primary and foreign key relationships are established. Following the setup of the data warehouse, Tableau will be utilized for visualization and reporting purposes. Visualizations will be generated to glean insights into flight punctuality trends, encompassing overall on-time performance, delay distributions by airline and airport, and comparisons between scheduled and chartered flights.

The objective is to harness the aircraft punctuality dataset to construct an efficient data warehouse, generate meaningful visualizations using Tableau, and provide insights that can guide decision-making and enhance overall flight punctuality and customer satisfaction.
